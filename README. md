C++ is statically-typed language which meand when we declare a valiable of a certain
type the variable cannot change its type throughout the lifetime of a program.

Other statically-typed languages:
- C#
- Java
- Go

In contrast dynamically-typed languages are
- Python
- JavaScript
- Ruby


Fundamental built-in Data types in C++:

For whole numbers:

Type      Bytes              Range
shot        2         -32,768 to 32,768
int         4             -2B to 2B
long        4             -2B to 2B
long long   8


For numbers with decimal places (Floating point numbers):

Type      Bytes              Range
float       4         -3.4E38 to 3.4E38
double      8         -1.7E308 to 1.7E308
long double 8         -3.4E932 to 1.7E4832

Use double for monetary values because floats can result in lose of accuracy.

Other fundamental types:

Type      Bytes              Range
bool        1             true / flase
char        1
